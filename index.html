    <p>My favorite drink in the world is a simple iced latte. There's something so comforting and fulfilling about getting a latte while I study at a cafe, spend the morning/afternoon with friends or simply drink while I run errands for the day. A latte is more than just a drink to me. When I get a latte I'm not just trying to get my caffiene fix for the day. I use my latte to symbolize the start of a good day, whether I am being productive or not. Some people find it silly that I get so much serotonin from a meer cup of coffee but to me it makes a world of a difference. That being said, the latte itself is best when the espresso is brewed with expertise and preciseness. I dislike nothing more than a cup of coffee that leaves a bitter, sour taste in my mouth so I prefer my espresso to be smooth with a nice depth of flavor. My superior milk of choice will always have to be either oat milk or soy milk. Those are the best plant-based milks for a latter in my opinion because they offer a perfect amount of creaminess and they won't overshadow the taste of the espresso. I also prefer to have no sweetener or syrups in my coffee because I'm not a sweets person. The color of the latte should serve as an indication of the quality. My color palette for an exceptional latte is closely represented by the color of brown craft paper. I can go on and on about my love for a perfect cup of coffee but I will always go back to why I drink lattes in the first place. There are very few things in the world that give me more joy than the experience of getting a latte. </p>
